# omni-applescripts

AppleScripts I use with [OmniGroup](https://www.omnigroup.com) apps to make specific tasks or workflows easier.

## OmniFocus

### Drop Action.scpt

Moves the selected actions to my ‚Äú‚ùå Dropped‚Äù context, and completes them.

### Mark as In Progress.scpt

Appends `(‚Ä¶)` to the selected actions. This is how I indicate an in-progress action, and certain perspectives search for that string to surface in-progress items.

### Mark as Waiting on Other.scpt

Moves the selected actions to my ‚ÄúüîÅ Waiting on Other‚Äù context.

### MoveToBottom.scpt and MoveToTop.scpt

Move the selected actions to the top or bottom of their projects.

I didn‚Äôt write these but I forget where they came from.

### Begin Work.scpt

Reminds you to stop working in 8 hours.

## OmniOutliner

### OmniOutliner Selected Rows to OmniFocus.scpt

Turns the selected rows into OmniFocus actions, via the Quick Entry window for edits. Properly converts the rows‚Äô notes to notes on the new OmniFocus actions.
